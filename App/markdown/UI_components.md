UI components
=======================

The user interface contains three types of objects in general

* **Inputs**. This allows the user to interact with the application.
* **Outputs**. Rendered objects from the server, such as plots and tables.
* **Lay-out objects**. Objects to create the lay-out of the user interface, such as columns and rows.
