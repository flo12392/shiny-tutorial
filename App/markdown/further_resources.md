* [shinydashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/). Great package for creating dashboards, it has some very useful components.
* [The DT package](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/). Very useful for creating styled tables, great for use within Shiny due to the [interaction possibilites](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/shiny.html).
* [plotly](https://plot.ly/r/). My go-to package for interactive plots; They look really good, based on D3.js, easily create [hover, select or click events](https://plot.ly/r/shiny-coupled-events/).
